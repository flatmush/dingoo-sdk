= Introduction =

Dingoo_SDK is meant to serve as a multi-platform SDK for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingoo Dingoo] A320's native operating system which is a variant of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroC/OS-II ÂµC/OS-II] (uCOS II).

For a list of games and applications built using some variant of the SDK, see the [DevelopedApplications] wiki page.

== Getting Help ==

=== Read Me ===
The [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file included in the highest level of the $DINGOO_SDK directory is the first place you should check for help. There are step-by-step installation instructions there for both Windows and Linux/UNIX build environments.
=== Wiki ===
The wiki is currently a work-in-progress and may not contain much helpful information at the moment, but we are actively working on it.

=== Documentation ===
Use Doxygen to build HTML documentation in the $DINGOO_SDK/doc directory. See the [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] for instructions.

=== Issues ===
The issues tracker is the best place to post bugs or other unusual errors that aren't the result of a failed or incorrect installation (see the [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file). We are also open to feature requests and suggestions as time allows.
