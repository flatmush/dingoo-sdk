= Introduction =

Dingoo_SDK is meant to serve as a multiplatform SDK for the Dingoo A320.

== Requirements ==
=== Linux ===
  * [http://flatmush.juliusparishy.com/a320/toolchain/mipsel-4.1.2-nopic.tar.bz2 Ingenic toolchain]
  * [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ Doxygen 1.5.8] (for building the documentation)
  * GNU make
=== Windows ===
  * [http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe CYGWIN (Latest version, though any version should work)]

  * [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ Doxygen 1.5.8] (for building the documentation)
  * [http://flatmush.juliusparishy.com/a320/toolchain/mipsel-gcc4.1-cygwin-nopic.tar.bz2 Windows MIPSEL Compiler]
== Getting Help ==
=== Read Me ===
The [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file included in the highest level of the $DINGOO_SDK directory is the first place you should check for help. There are step-by-step installation instructions there for both Windows and Linux/UNIX build environments.
=== Wiki ===
The wiki is currently a work-in-progress and may not contain much helpful information at the moment, but we are actively working on it.
=== Documentation ===
Use Doxygen to build HTML documentation in the $DINGOO_SDK/doc directory. See the [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] for instructions.
=== Issues ===
The issues tracker is the best place to post bugs or other unusual errors that aren't the result of a failed or incorrect installation (see the [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file). We are also open to feature requests and suggestions as time allows.
