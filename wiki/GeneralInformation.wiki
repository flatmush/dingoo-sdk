== Getting Help ==
=== Read Me ===
The [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file included in the highest level of the $DINGOO_SDK directory is the first place you should check for help. There are step-by-step installation instructions there for both Windows and Linux/UNIX build environments.
=== Wiki ===
The wiki is currently a work-in-progress and may not contain much helpful information at the moment, but we are actively working on it.
=== Issues ===
The issues tracker is the best place to post bugs or other unusual errors that aren't the result of a failed or incorrect installation (see the [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/source/browse/trunk/dingoo_sdk/ReadMe.txt ReadMe.txt] file). We are also open to feature requests and suggestions as time allows.
