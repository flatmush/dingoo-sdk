=sml/control.h=
Defines the button codes and methods for polling the buttons for changes in
their state.
==Macros==
===Control codes===
  * *CONTROL_POWER*: the power slider (does not track the HOLD position)
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_A*: the A button
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_B*: the B button
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_X*: the X button
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_Y*: the Y button
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_START*: the START button (does not exist on the Gemei X760+)
  * *CONTROL_BUTTON_SELECT*: the SELECT button (does not exist on the Gemei X760+)
  * *CONTROL_TRIGGER_LEFT*: the left shoulder button (does not exist on the Gemei X760+)
  * *CONTROL_TRIGGER_RIGHT*: the right shoulder button (does not exist on the Gemei X760+)
  * *CONTROL_DPAD_UP*: the UP button on the directional pad
  * *CONTROL_DPAD_DOWN*: the DOWN button on the directional pad
  * *CONTROL_DPAD_LEFT*: the LEFT button on the directional pad
  * *CONTROL_DPAD_RIGHT*: the RIGHT button on the directional pad

===Methods===
  * _int_ *control_just_pressed*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): returns 0 if the control state is set to "just recently pressed", non-zero otherwise.
  * _int_ *control_just_released*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): returns 0 if the control state is set to "just recently released", non-zero otherwise.  * _int_ *control_still_pressed*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): returns 0 if the control state is set to "still pressed", non-zero otherwise.  * _int_ *control_still_released*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): returns 0 if the control state is set to "still released", non-zero otherwise.
==Structs==
===control_state===
Members:
  * _bool_ *changed*: indicates this control has changed since the last check
  * _bool_ *pressed*: indicates this control is being pressed down
  * _bool_ *repeat*: indicates this control is _still_ being held down since the last check
==Methods==
Non-macro global methods.
  * _void_ *control_init*( _void_ ): initializes the control state tracker
  * _void_ *control_term*( _void_ ): terminates the control state tracker
  * _void_ *control_poll*( _void_ ): updates the control state tracker
  * [#control_state control_state] *control_check*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): gets the status of the specified control
  * _void_ *control_lock*( [#Control_codes control_code] ): prevents the specified control from being tracked
