This sample is more meant to be a sample than to be a game.
It's currently not very exciting to play because it's easy to predict how the ball bounces.

The sample provides the following:
* A makefile for C++ / SDL
* An example game loop (there are many different ways of doing this, probably many better ways also)
* SDL_image usage (png splash screen)
* SDL_mixer usage (sound and music)
* SDL_ttf usage (fonts and text)
* A way to handle keys

The sample supports optional music, simply put music.ogg in the same directory.
