INSTRUCTIONS

Try to land your craft on the green landing pad.
Bonuses are given for:
	- Landing close to the center of the pad.
	- Landing gently.
	- Landing quickly.
	- Landing using less fuel.
	- Playing at a higher difficulty level.
There are multiple hud elements to help you:
	- The red bar is your health, you will die if it empties.
	- The yellow bar is your fuel, you will die if it empties.
	- The green squares are you lives.
	- The blue triangle/square is the target indicator,
		it indicates the direction of the landing pad.
	- The alt indicator is a rough estimate of your altitude.
