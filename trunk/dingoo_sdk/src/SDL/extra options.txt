You may use environment variables to specify extra options for SDL.

Use SDL_putenv() before calling SDL_Init().

Example usage:
SDL_putenv("DINGOO_IGNORE_OS_EVENTS=1");


Available options:
DINGOO_IGNORE_OS_EVENTS			If set, don't quit on OS events such as holding X


(More options are planned and will be available at a later time)
